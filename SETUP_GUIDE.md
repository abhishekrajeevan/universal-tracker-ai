## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Connection Test Fails

**Error: "Please enter an Apps Script URL first"**

**Error: "HTTP 403" or "Access denied"**
- Check that your Apps Script is deployed with "Anyone" access
- Make sure you clicked "Deploy" and not just "Save"

**Error: "HTTP 404" or "Not found"**
- Verify the URL is correct (should end with `/exec`)
- Make sure the Apps Script is deployed as a Web App

**Error: "Failed to fetch"**
- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the Apps Script deployment

### No Data Appearing in Sheet

1. Check if the "Items_Active" sheet was created
2. Try clicking **üîÑ Sync** in the extension popup
3. Check the browser console for error messages (F12 ‚Üí Console)

### Apps Script Permissions

1. Go back to Apps Script editor
2. Click **Review permissions**
3. Choose your Google account
4. Click **Advanced** ‚Üí **Go to Universal Tracker API (unsafe)**
5. Click **Allow**

## üîÑ How the Connection Works

1. **Extension** stores items locally in Chrome storage
2. **Background script** periodically syncs to Google Sheets via Apps Script
3. **Apps Script** receives data and writes to your spreadsheet
4. **Archiving** happens automatically when you have many items

## üìä What You'll See

After setup, your Google Sheet will have:
- **Items_Active**: Your recent items (last 6 months)
- **Items_Archive_YYYY_MM**: Older items organized by month
- **Formatted headers**: Blue for active, green for archives
- **Automatic organization**: Items are categorized and tagged

## üö® Important Notes

- **Keep your Apps Script URL private** - it gives access to your spreadsheet
- **Don't delete the Apps Script** - it's needed for the extension to work
- **The extension works offline** - items are stored locally and synced when online
- **Archiving is automatic** - old items are moved to keep performance fast

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

1. **Check the browser console** (F12 ‚Üí Console) for error messages
2. **Verify your Apps Script deployment** settings
3. **Try the connection test** in the options page
4. **Make sure you're using the correct URL** (ends with `/exec`)
